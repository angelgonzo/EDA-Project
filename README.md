# EDA-Project

Hello! This is my second project which build of my first project. In this project we take a look at smaller sets of data based on different categories such as dates, total laid off, and company. This takes the database I cleaned up and allows me to look at any outliers or specific trends during that time period of 2020-2023 which was peak covid time. I discovered that a lot of tech companies such as Meta and Google had no problem laying off people during this time, which was quite surprising. Nonetheless, I feel as if this project was a tad bit harder but fun at the same time as it takes what we learned and uses it in even tighter cases. I have to state this once more but this project is not an original idea and was a code-along from AlexTheAnalyst.
