# EDA-Project

In this project, I used the clean data set from the first project and furthered analyzed the different categories. This way I could see different trends among the 3 years this dataset encompasses. I narrowed down each data by individual selecting categories and ordering them by different variables such as the date, or total people laid off. This way I can see the data from different viewpoints. For example, seeing how many people were laid off during 2020 by X company. This help vizualize the effect Covid-19 had in the world and the actions these companies took to stay afloat.


Hello! This is my second project which build of my first project. I feel as if this project was a tad bit harder but fun at the same time as it takes what we learned and uses it in even tighter cases. I have to state this once more but this project is not an original idea and was a code-along from AlexTheAnalyst. I like how this project used a lot more advance queries that I havent been too familiar with such as using CTE to create Rolling Sums, which I think was a good chance to get my hands dirty with.
